[h1]Revolutionary Confederation[/h1]
[i]A Revolutionary Confederation is a mixture of a vassal and a personal union. If it borders its overlord or other Revolutionary Confederations of its overlord as well as another country that is not a Revolutionary Confederation and not the Revolution Target, it does not cost a diplomatic relation. It can only be established by the Revolution Target on independent monarchies and republics with their capital on the same continent. A Revolutionary Confederation can only be established by war with the 'Spread the Revolution' or 'Crush the Revolution' Casus Belli. It has a lower liberty desire than vassals and pays taxes to its overlord, but it has the same ruler as its overlord. A Revolutionary Confederation gains half of the bonuses the Revolution Target gains and gives its overlord a bonus on the military skill of future rulers and legitimacy, if it is a monarchy, a bonus to republican tradition and influence of the Girondists faction, if it's a republic, as well as a bonus on aggressive expansion. If the overlord of a Revolutionary Confederation is not the Revolution Target anymore, the Revolutionary Confederation receives additional +100% liberty desire.[/i]

[h1]Satrapy[/h1]
[i]A Satrapy is a mixture of a vassal and a colonial nation. It behaves like a vassal, but is a little bit less restricted in its diplomatic actions and has a reduced liberty desire, and pays tariffs like a colonial nation. It only joins its overlord's defensive wars, but the overlord can conscript troops from all Satrapies, which works similar to the Daimyo's Sword Hunt. A Satrapy will automatically switch to a Republican Dictatorship. It can only be established by monarchies that are either Persia or a nation with the primary culture Persian, with a primary culture in the Iranian group that is also their dominant culture, with a primary culture not in the Iranian group but with any of them being the dominant culture as well as an accepted culture or with Persian as the accepted culture and at least 10 Persian provinces on neighboring countries. A Satrapy does not cost a diplomatic relation, if it has it's capital in the same region as its overlord. A Satrapy gains a bonus on culture conversion cost and primary culture advisor cost and gives its overlord a bonus on possible advisors and minimum autonomy in territories.[/i]

[h1]Integrated Personal Union[/h1]

[h1]Iqta[/h1]
[i]An Iqta behaves similar as a normal vassal, but is a little bit less restricted in its diplomatic actions, has a slightly reduced liberty desire and pays less money to its overlord, and is locked to be a monarchy. It joins its overlord's wars and doesn't cost a relation slot, if it has its overlord's religion and at least 75% religious unity. It has to have its overlord's religion for him to prepare the annexation, which is needed to be able to annex it. This preparation increases its liberty desire and gives it maluses that effectively half the bonuses it gets from being an Iqta. It gains bonuses on tax income, mercenacy cost and army maintenance cost and grants its overlord a bonus on missionary strength and missionary maintenance cost. Furthermore, an Iqta is influenced towards Mysticism, if it follows its overlord's religion, and towards Legalism, if it doesn't. Enabling scutage will change the liberty desire of an Iqta by -10% as long as the annexation was not prepared. It can only be established by Muslim nations in other, neighboring Muslim nations, and a country can have at most 2 Iqtas. If an Iqta switches to another religion group, it is forced to either switch to its overlord's religion or declare an independence war. A Muslim Iqta can get events that the spread its overlord's religion in its provinces.[/i]

[h1]Papal Sanctuary[/h1]

It cannot be annexed and doesn't cost a diplomatic relation, if it is a theocracy, Curia Controller, Defender of Faith or a neighbor of the Crusade Target. It pays only very few taxes to its overlord, but grants it a bonus on tax income, diplomatic reputation and devotion. A Papal Sanctuary itself gains a bonus on tax income, legitimacy equivalent, yearly papal influence and religious unity. The overlord can ask a Papal Sanctuary to become a theocracy and to become a direct vassal. It can decide to become independent diplomatically, however only with enough liberty desire, if excommunicated, if the overlord is excommunicated or if the overlord doesn't fulfill the requirements of being an overlord anymore. A Papal Sanctuary can only be established by the Catholic Papal State or owner of the Papal government or "Kingdom of God" modifier (if the Papal State doesn't exist) in independent, Catholic nations on the same continent that neither were excommunicated nor have enacted the Statute in Restraint of Appeals.[/i]

The overlord is called to arms to the Imperial Feud's defensive wars, but the overlord can decline. However declining will decrease the other Imperial Feud's and HRE members opinions of him. An Imperial Feud gains a bonus on tax income, fort maintenance and land forcelimit and grants its overlord a bonus on tax income and imperial authority gain. It can be asked to join the HRE or to become a vassal after 10 years. It has low liberty desire, but gains additional liberty desire after being 11, 15, 20, 25 and 30 years under its overlord. An Imperial Feud is a voluntary subject, which means it can become independent diplomatically. An Imperial Feud can only be established by the Holy Roman Emperor in non-HRE countries that border the HRE before the "Revoke the Privilegia" reform. If the emperor title gets passed to another country, an Imperial Feud can either become independent or will be passed from its old overlord to the new emperor.[/i]

[h1]Chiefdom[/h1]
[i]Chiefdoms are very similar to marches, however they get a bonus to horde unity, manpower and army morale. Furthermore, they give their overlord a bonus on core creation cost and fabricate claim cost. If their overlord is a horde, he has two additional actions that he can use on Chiefdoms: In exchange for horde unity, he can gain a small bonus on looting speed and movement speed as well as a small malus on aggressive expansion impact. And in exchange for the subject getting an increase in liberty desire, he can gain a small bonus on horde unity and a small malus on aggressive expansion impact. A Chiefdom gains additional liberty desire, if it has at least 75% of its overlord's army size. It can only be established by independent nations following a religion of the Pagan, American Pagan, Slavic Pagan or German Pagan religion groups or the Druidist or Zamolxist religions, on their own vassals that follow any of these religions or a religion in any of those groups as well.[/i]
